# User configuration.
#
# This file defines each user recognized by the system security policy
# if MLS is not enabled.
# Only the user identities defined in this file may be used as the
# user attribute in a security context.
#
# Each user has a set of roles that may be entered by processes
# with the user's identity.  The syntax of a user declaration is:
#
# 	user username roles role_set ;
#

#
# system_u is the user identity for system processes and objects.
# There should be no corresponding Unix user identity for system_u,
# and a user process should never be assigned the system_u user
# identity.
#
user system_u roles system_r;

# 
# user_u is the fallback FMAC user identity for users who
# have no specific FMAC user identity in the policy.  It
# is limited to the unprivileged user_r role.
user user_u roles { user_r };

#
# sysadm_u is the user identity for system administration.
#

user sysadm_u roles { user_r sysadm_r };
